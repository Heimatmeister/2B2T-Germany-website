				2b2t germany runs on automated payments from its Bank account account, which needs at least 117€ for it to pay for itself at the end of every month. if the server goes unpaid for a week after a month ends, it automatically shuts down.

				no bullshit included in donations needed, exact prices and information written out in the 'info' tab. no one is profiting from this.<br />

							There are currently four things possible to buy:
							<br></br>
							A permanent server browser message which is cycled together with many others. You can see it demonstrated by adding the server to your server list and pressing refresh a few times.
							<br>This costs $1, and will stay forever. The only rule is no ads and links, other than that your message can contain anything.</br>
							<br>The other thing that is possible to buy is a temporary server browser message(s) and MOTD for $2. The server browser message(s) will OVERRIDE the cycled ones, and always stay visible during their duration.</br>
							The messages in-game will be displayed upon logon in shiny yellow at the top of the chat. The only rule for the motd is that it can't be longer than 5 chat lines. If you break this rule, I will tell you by replying to your mail.
							<br>For $2, a message will be displayed for 48 hours, for $4 it will be 96 hours and so on, unless requested to be split up.</br>
							<br>The third thing possible to buy is a custom 64x64 .png image that is displayed in the server browser. You can see it the same way you see the rotating server browser messages. This custom image costs $2 per 24 hours, and the rules for it are no gore/porn/cp.</br>
							<br>To buy any of these, donate the amount required for what you want to buy to 2b2t.net@gmail.com through paypal (linked to the left) and after donating send a message to 2b2t.net@gmail.com containing your mail used for paypal, and your messages and/or picture.</br>
							<br>You can use this format to make it easier:</br>
							Mail used for paypal:
							<br>Server browser message(s):</br>
							Message of the day:
							<br></br>
							When buying $2 temporary messages, it is possible to have several rotated server browser messages as well, just request so when sending the mail.
							<br>I suggest that when purchasing any of these things that you limit yourself to not more than 5 days, this is so that everyone can have a chance at their messages and pictures displayed!</br>
							<br />
							Last thing you can buy (experimental, but don't worry your money won't be wasted):<br />
							Activate or extend the word changer for 48 hours, 2$. Add a word to be changed into something, 1$ per word. Add a sentence ending, 1$ per line.<br />
							<br />
							Examples: Nothing going on: "hello, i love everyone!". Someone buys "damn" as a sentence ending, now it has a chance to appear after everyones sentences, like: "hello, i love everyone! damn".<br />
							Or someone buys the word hello to be changeded into bye, then it has a chance to become: "bye, i love everyone! damn".<br />
							Limits and rules: Two words per one word to be changed, as in you can not make hello be changed into "this many words" but only "this many". You can't purchase single letters or articles (The, And, An etc). You can't make it spam, for example turning "hello" into "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" or similar. For sentence finishes, just don't make them too long or they will disappear due to chatbox limit.<br />
							<br />
							When purchasing, do just like above with motds and messages, donate the amount required then send "2b2t.net@gmail.com" a mail containing your words and other.
							<br />
							The words you purchase are added into a global list that is always used when the word changer is enabled. One word can be changed into multiple different words at the same time, so if you and two others purchase "hello" to be changed into three different things, they all have a chance to happen. If something isn't clear or you're not understanding, just contact me! Click the contact tab above.
